# About

I am software engineer with experience in functional programming on the backend, though I am also comfortable with frontend technologies.

I am always eager to learn new things and step out of my comfort zone. I thrive in environments where I can take responsibility for delivering meaningful and valuable outcomes, and where engineers are trusted to make decisions and act autonomously.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve come to deeply value collaborating with people from diverse mindsets and roles. I believe that frequent and effective communication is key not only to building a successful business but also to excelling as a software engineer.
